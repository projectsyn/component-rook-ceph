= Configuring and tuning Ceph

This how-to gives some configuration snippets to configure and tune the Ceph cluster.

See https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.6/ceph-cluster-crd.html[the Rook.io `CephCluster`] documentation for Ceph configuration options which are exposed by the Rook-Ceph operator.
See https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/configuration/ceph-conf/[Ceph documentation] for the upstream Ceph configuration documentation.

== Configure Ceph's backing storage

To configure the component for an infrastructure which provides backing storage as storageclass `localblock-storage`, simply provide the following config.

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  rook_ceph:
    ceph_cluster:
      block_storage_class: localblock-storage
----

=== Tune backing storage for SSDs

If the backing storage provided for Ceph is itself backed by SSDs (or better), you can tune Ceph for "fast" devices with the following config.

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  rook_ceph:
    ceph_cluster:
      tune_fast_device_class: true
----

== Configure target size of RBD block pool

To tell the Ceph cluster that the default RBD block pool, which is named `storagepool`, is expected to take up 80% of the Ceph cluster's capacity, the following config can be provided.

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  rook_ceph:
    ceph_cluster:
      storage_pools:
        rbd:
          storagepool:
            config:
              parameters:
                target_size_ratio: "0.8"
----

== Configure Ceph options which aren't exposed by the Rook-Ceph operator

To configure a Ceph option which isn't exposed by the operator, you can provide raw Ceph configuration entries in parameter xref:references/parameters.adoc#_config_override[`ceph_cluster.config_override`].

For example, to change the OSD operations queue (`op_queue`) scheduler to `wpq` for a Ceph v17 cluster, you can provide the following config.

[TIP]
====
Ceph v17 has switched to `mclock_scheduler` by default.
We've benchmarked both the `wpq` and `mclock_scheduler` for Ceph v17 and didn't see significant differences on an idle cluster.

`mclock_scheduler` should provide improved client workload performance during recovery events if the cluster is heavily utilized.
Additionally, recovery events should be able to consume more capacity when there's little client load on the cluster.

See the https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/rados/configuration/osd-config-ref/#dmclock-qos[Ceph documentation] for more details.
====


[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  rook_ceph:
    ceph_cluster:
      config_override:
        osd:
          osd_op_queue: wpq
----

As discussed in xref:references/parameters.adoc#_config_override[the parameter's documentation], the contents of `ceph_cluster.config_override` are rendered into __ini__ style format by the component.

Each key in the parameter is used as the name of a section in the resulting _ini_ style configuration file.

== Configure Ceph full ratios

Ceph has https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/configuration/mon-config-ref/#storage-capacity[configuration options] to control at which point the cluster starts warning about potential service interruptions due to running out of disk space.

The component sets the config options `mon_osd_full_ratio=0.85`, `mon_osd_backfillfull_ratio=0.8` and `mon_osd_nearfull_ratio=0.75` in the Rook `config-override` configmap.
With this configuration, the Ceph cluster will go into read-only mode when it's utilized to 85% of its capacity.

You can tune these options before creating the Ceph cluster by providing the following config.

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  rook_ceph:
    ceph_cluster:
      config_override:
        global:
          mon_osd_full_ratio: '0.9' <1>
          mon_osd_nearfull_ratio: '0.8' <2>
          mon_osd_backfillfull_ratio: '0.85' <3>
----
<1> Configure the cluster to become read-only (OSD status `full`) at 90% utilization.
We give the ratios as strings to avoid the resulting configuration containing values like `0.90000000000000002` due to floating point rounding issues.
<2> Configure the threshold at which the OSD status becomes `nearfull`.
<3> Configure the threshold at which Ceph won't backfill more data to the OSD.

At runtime, you can adjust the cluster's ratios with

[source,bash]
----
kubectl --as=cluster-admin exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph osd set-full-ratio 0.9 <1>
kubectl --as=cluster-admin exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph osd set-nearfull-ratio 0.8 <2>
kubectl --as=cluster-admin exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph osd set-backfillfull-ratio 0.85 <3>
----
<1> Configure the cluster to become read-only (OSD status `full`) at 90% utilization.
<2> Configure the threshold at which the OSD status becomes `nearfull`.
<3> Configure the threshold at which Ceph won't backfill more data to the OSD.
