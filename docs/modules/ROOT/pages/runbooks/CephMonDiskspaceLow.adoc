= Alert rule: CephMonDiskspaceLow

== icon:glasses[] Overview

The space available to a monitor's store is approaching full (>70% is the default).
You should increase the space available to the monitor(s).
The monitor's store can be found at `/var/lib/rook/<MON_NAME>/data` on the host.

Look for old, rotated versions of `*.log` and `MANIFEST*`.
IMPORTANT: Don't touch any `*.sst` files.
Also check any other directories under `/var/lib/rook` and other directories on the same filesystem, often `/var/log` and `/var/tmp` are culprits.
