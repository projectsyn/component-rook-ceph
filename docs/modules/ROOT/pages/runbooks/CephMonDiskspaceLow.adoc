= Alert rule: CephMonDiskspaceLow

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

The space available to a monitor's store is approaching full (>70% is the default).
You should increase the space available to the monitor(s).
The default directory is `/var/lib/ceph/mon-*/data/store.db` on traditional deployments, and `/var/lib/rook/mon-*/data/store.db` on the mon pod's worker node for rook.
Look for old, rotated versions of `*.log` and `MANIFEST*`.
IMPORTANT: Don't touch any `*.sst` files.
Also check any other directories under `/var/lib/rook` and other directories on the same filesystem, often `/var/log` and `/var/tmp` are culprits.
Your monitor hosts are; {{- range query "ceph_mon_metadata"}} - {{ .Labels.hostname }} {{- end }}
