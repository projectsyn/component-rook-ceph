= Alert rule: CephOSDBackfillFull

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

An OSD has reached the BACKFILL FULL threshold.
This will prevent rebalance operations from completing.
Use `ceph health detail` and `ceph osd df` to identify the problem.
To resolve, add capacity to the affected OSD's failure domain, restore down/out OSDs, or delete unwanted data.

== icon:bug[] Steps for debugging

=== Check current capacity utilisation
