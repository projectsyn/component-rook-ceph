== icon:glasses[] Overview

This alert fires if a Ceph OSD pod was marked down and back up at least once a minute for 5 minutes.
This may indicate a network issue (latency, packet loss, MTU mismatch) on the cluster network, or the public network if no cluster network is deployed.
Check the network stats on the listed host(s).
