= Alert rule: CephOSDFull

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

This alert fires when utilization of a Ceph storage device (disk) is higher than 85% of the device's capacity.
Most likely, the Ceph cluster is in read-only mode when this alert fires.

This alert may indicate that the cluster utilization has reached problematic levels.
If this alert is triggered by high cluster utilization, unused data should be deleted or the cluster size must be increased.

Otherwise, investigate why this particular device has higher utilization than the other storage devices in the Ceph cluster.

== icon:bug[] Steps for debugging

See the how-to on xref:how-tos/scale-cluster.adoc[scaling a PVC-based Ceph cluster] for instructions to resize the cluster.
