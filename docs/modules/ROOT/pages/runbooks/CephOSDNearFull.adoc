= Alert rule: CephOSDNearFull

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

One or more OSDs have reached the NEARFULL threshold.
To resolve, add capacity to the affected OSD's failure domain, restore down/out OSDs, or delete unwanted data.

This alert may indicate that the cluster utilization will soon reach problematic levels.
If this alert is caused by high cluster utilization, unused data should be deleted or the cluster size must be increased.

Otherwise, investigate why this particular device has higher utilization than the other storage devices in the Ceph cluster.

== icon:bug[] Steps for debugging

See the how-to on xref:how-tos/scale-cluster.adoc[scaling a PVC-based Ceph cluster] for instructions to resize the cluster.
