= Alert rule: CephPGNotDeepScrubbed

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

One or more PGs haven't been deep scrubbed recently.
Deep scrubs protect against bit-rot.
They compare data replicas to ensure consistency.
When PGs miss their deep scrub interval, it may indicate that the window is too small or PGs weren't in a `clean` state during the deep-scrub window.
