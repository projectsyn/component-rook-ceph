= Alert rule: CephPGNotDeepScrubbed

== icon:glasses[] Overview

One or more PGs have not been deep scrubbed recently.
Deep scrub is a data integrity feature, protecting against bit-rot.
It compares the contents of objects and their replicas for inconsistency.
When PGs miss their deep scrub window, it may indicate that the window is too small or PGs were not in a 'clean' state during the deep-scrub window.
