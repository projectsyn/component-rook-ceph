= Alert rule: CephPGNotScrubbed

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

One or more PGs haven't been scrubbed recently.
Scrubs check metadata integrity, protecting against bit-rot.
They check that metadata is consistent across data replicas.
When PGs miss their scrub interval, it may indicate that the scrub window is too small, or PGs weren't in a `clean` state during the scrub window.
