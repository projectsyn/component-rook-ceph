= Alert rule: CephPGNotScrubbed

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

One or more PGs have not been scrubbed recently.
The scrub process is a data integrity feature, protectng against bit-rot.
It checks that objects and their metadata (size and attributes) match across object replicas.
When PGs miss their scrub window, it may indicate the scrub window is too small, or PGs were not in a 'clean' state during the scrub window.
