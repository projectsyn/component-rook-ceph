= Alert rule: CephPoolNearFull

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

This alert fires when the Ceph cluster utilization is close to 75% of the cluster capacity.
Writes may continue, but you are at risk of the pool going read only if more capacity isn't made available.

To resolve this alert, unused data should be deleted or the cluster size must be increased.

== icon:bug[] Steps for debugging

// Add detailed steps to debug and resolve the issue
See the how-to on xref:how-tos/scale-cluster.adoc[scaling a PVC-based Ceph cluster] for instructions to resize the cluster.
