= Alert rule: CephSlowOps

include::partial$runbooks/contribution_note.adoc[]

== icon:glasses[] Overview

This alert fires if some Ceph OSD requests take too long to process.
Slow OSD requests may be the cause of PVCs taking a long time to become bound to a PV.

Most likely, slow requests will be caused by heavy load on the Ceph cluster.
See the https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-osd/#blocked-requests-or-slow-requests[Ceph documentation] for a more detailed explanation of possible causes of slow requests.
