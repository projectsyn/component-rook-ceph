=== Find degraded PGs

=== Trigger a repeer of degraded PGs

During initial testing and benchmarking, we've found that sometimes triggering a repeer of PGs in state `degraded+undersized` can unstick the recovery process.
You can use the shell snippet below to trigger a repeer for all `degraded+undersized` PGs.

[source,shell]
----
ceph_cluster_ns=syn-rook-ceph-cluster
for pgid in $(kubectl -n "${ceph_cluster_ns}" exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools \
              -- ceph pg dump_stuck undersized -f json | sed 's/}ok/}/' | \
              jq -r '.stuck_pg_stats[] | .pgid')
do
    kubectl -n "${ceph_cluster_ns}" exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph pg repeer "${pgid}"
done

=== Check Ceph status

The following command should show a line starting with `recovery:` under `io:` if Ceph is making progress recovering the degraded PGs.

[source,shell]
----
ceph_cluster_ns=syn-rook-ceph-cluster
kubectl -n ${ceph_cluster_ns} exec -it deploy/rook-ceph-tools -- ceph status
